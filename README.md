Large T-Slot Tantillus
======================

This is the repository for source files, STL files and sparce instructions for building the Large T-Slot Tantillus 3D Printer - The source is derived from both the original Tantillus printer and it's T-slot Tantillus derivative. I have not forked either as I'm an unfortunate combination of crap with github and lazy, apologies in advance to Sublime and GoopyPlastic. Please note, this project is an early  WORK IN PROGRESS.
